For workshop 9, we should read a file and allocate dynamic memory to the size of the file on the disk, so we need to calculate the size of the text file in bytes. The function provided called getFileLength can get position with tellg() and set position with seekg(). After receiving the size of the text file, we can allocate dynamic memory into content. Moreover, in HTMLText.cpp, the override function of  HTMLText::write is to convert the text file into HTML format. While passing H2 object to H3 by copy assignment operator in line 53 in main.cpp, I couldn¡¦t receive Text.content and always be nullptr. I set the breakpoint to go through my copy assignment operator, and I realize we should call the base copy assignment operator to copy the content information to H3 object. After receiving the correct content and title, another issue is to read the file character by character in HtmlText::write override. By calling Text::operator[](index), we can get each character in the content array and set some condition to print out the correct format of HTML. I used do while and switch condition to complete my write function.
